		<h4>Motivation</h4>
		<p>The current system of Intelligent Apartment for elderly was out of scope. My research here focused on the potencial requirement and perspective improvement. When I considered how to match the requirement of Access Control System perfectly, I proposed a widespread mechanism--Call Transfer--to replace the video conference architecture and revised SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) workflow. In addition, I also suggested the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to cut down the demand of support staffs. Taking graduate design as an opportunity, this is a perspective exploration on functions of access control system and call center.</p>
		<h4>Requirement Analysis</h4>
		<p>This system mainly serves the visitors of Intelligent Apartment. When the visitors standing at the door, they can communicate with this system for the help of finding their relatives or friends. Three ways are described below:</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
			<li>If visitor is familiar with the elderly, they can directly call him via the SIP terminal.</li>
			<li>If visitor can only remember some information about the elderly, the self-service terminal can be used for interactive voice response (IVR).</li>
			<li>If visitor cannot explicitly describe the details about the elderly, the terminal can transfer the call to the apartment administrator for help.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Design &amp; Implementation.</h4>
		<p>The solution includes six separate parts: IMS Client, IMS Application Server (AS), IMS Core, Web Client, Web Server and Information Database. GryffinAS is focus on IMS Application Server, achieving IVR Function and Call Manipulation.</p>
		<p>Based on JAIN SLEE, I primarily designed the business logic of the AS, serving as signal proxy between Client and Media Server (MS). According to the customized script on business logic, GryffinAS can provide corresponding media service for its clients.</p>

		<p>The primary work in this project is to design the SLEE-based Service Building Blocks (SBBs) and MRCP4J-based Resource Adaptor (RA). In terms of the design of SBBs, it involves <i>CallSbb</i> and <i>IVRSbb</i>, respectively handling SIP messages and Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) messages.</p>
		<p>When it comes to RA, I designed the interface and implementation of resource adaptor strictly follow the design patterns of JAIN SLEE.</p>
		<p>When considering the aspect of implementation, three key jobs has been completed:</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: decimal">
			<li>Message interpretation and package encapsulation are well-developed for adding media resource control signal.</li>
			<li>The design of MRCP RA has considered interface definition for SBB for controlling media resources, including speech recognition &amp; synthesis.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Vision</h4>
		<p>With social wealth increasing, apartments for elderly have been developing and perfecting. More and more old people enjoy leisure and recreation here; They access healthcare of good quality with well-equipped facilities and elegant environment. GryffinAS, a prototype of IMS-based value-added service in IVR technology, will serve an important prospect in the future.</p>
