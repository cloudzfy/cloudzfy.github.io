		<h4>Inspiration</h4>
		<p>Nowadays, since IMS plays an important role in worldwide telecommunication network, more and more professionals are required, which leads to the requirement of courses for graduate and undergraduate students, and some universities have opened IMS technology courses for graduate and undergraduate students. However, few projects can be found to instruct student training on IMS technology. This project is mainly designed in response to this requirement of helping graduate and undergraduate students to master the IMS software development skills in a period of three weeks.</p>
		<p>In this simple IMS Client and IMS Application Server (AS), in order to meet the requirement of teaching experiments limited in three weeks, we have decomposed the whole implementation into three parts: <b>Private Chat Function</b>, <b>Public Chat Function</b> and <b>Presence Service Function</b>.</p>

		<h4>Design &amp; Technology</h4>
		<p>This solution contains multiple parts of network elements (IMS UE, IMS AS, IMS Core, etc.). My research focus on PC-based IMS UE for teaching experiments.</p>
		<p>In order to save hours in identifying defects and performance problems, we use Miscrosoft Visual Studio as our development toolkit to develop simple IMS Client. Runtime platform is .NET Framework 3.5, since we also use Doubango IMS Framework for the lower layer of implementation, which can only be built in such environment.</p>
		<p>The test environment in this series of teaching cases, the Fraunhofer Institute FOKUS is introduced for organizing IMS Core environment. It is an Open Source implementation of IMS Call Session Control Functions (CSCFs) and a lightweight Home Subscriber Server (HSS).</p>

		<p>The Teaching Cases contains three different parts: each part is related to others and instruct students to learn the sophisticated details step by step.</p>

			<li>IMS-based Windows Half-duplex Chat Room in Console</li>
			<li>IMS-based Windows Full-duplex Chat Room in GUI</li>

		<p>Students who are assigned in PC Client Group should finish the experiments by corperating with members of other groups for system test.</p>
