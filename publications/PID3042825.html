			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>IVR is well known for being able to facilitate interaction between user and computer system. Integrated into IMS service platform, IVR applications can provide value-added services for IMS subscribers. According to the survey of current situation on IVR systems, this research mainly proposes a more flexible and scalable solution on IMS-based AS/MRFC model for IVR services by providing efficient business adaptation. Deployed on JAIN SLEE, this solution can work with MRFP to provide IVR services to IMS users. Finally, this solution is proved its feasibility and compatibility, and shows its broad prospects through some application scenarios. This paper discusses problem analysis, architecture design, application implementation and system evaluation of this solution.</p>
