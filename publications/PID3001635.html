			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) has been deployed worldwide for several years, but some people, especially beginners, are still confused about what we can do with IMS. This paper presents the design and implementation of two lab experiments to help students to learn about the IMS. We focus on the development of two IMS services on an IMS Application Server: Chat Room and Presence Service. The architecture and the detailed design of the services are presented. These two experiments have been applied to the practical training courses for undergraduate students.</p>
