			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) has been deployed worldwide for several years, but we are still confused about what we can do with IMS. Sponsored by Beijing Education Commission, we did some exploring study on IMS Service and also designed two lab experiments to help students to learn about the IMS. We focus on the development of two IMS services, Chat Room and Presence Service, on an IMS SIP Application Server. The architecture and the detailed design of the services are presented. These two experiments have been applied to the practical training course for undergraduate students.</p>
